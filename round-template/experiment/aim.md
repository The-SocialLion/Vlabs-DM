#### To study and understand the concept of one bit quantization for the given binary data and to evaluate the Bandwidth, Power and Signal to Noise Ratio for analyzing the correctness of the received signal in delta modulation using the Virtual Labs Assessment Tool (V.L.A.T).

#### The user will be able to perform modulation process by transmitting 1 bit per symbol which conserves the bandwidth.
